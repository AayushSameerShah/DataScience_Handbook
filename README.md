### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Some Little Background
I started learning about Data Science from this book in *early 2021*. This is my *very first book* to learn and get the grasp on the various libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciKit Learn etc. *for the first time*. 

With *simple and easy to follow* language, this book has made a huge impact in my knowledge and understanding on various topics. The machine learning section in this books is so well. He explains models on higher level to get you excited. It is not a book specially made for ML so covering all aspects is not possible, but still it will get you started.

### üò¨ My First Attempt
Since I was introduced to the tools like jupyter notebook and markdown there, I took my notes not intended to share with everyone. So you may find the books - not in well explainable way as I do in all repositories. 

***WARNING YOU:*** These are my **personal** notes. This there is a high chance that it can contain some inappropriate language which I may have used to make my understandings more clear. 

### There is much stuff to consume ‚Äî Just dive in!

Thanks!<br>
